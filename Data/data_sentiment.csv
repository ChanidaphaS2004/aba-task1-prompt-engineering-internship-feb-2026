  Also the windows had no soundproofing whatsoever because the noise was too much!! Also the room had a hair dryer and a kettle that we could not use because the plugs did not fit the sockets and the hotel didn't provide adaptors...So no use of that service in the room either!"

456,Staff,However when I booked this property in advance it was a higher price but booking.com reduced the price before my travel date and the hotel refused to accept the lower price which I felt was unfair for me as they charged twice for cancellation and rebooking. Maybe this was a booking.com issue or the hotel but I was quite unhappy about this since it was not justified by the owner. I spoke to Ali from booking.com and he said there was no cancellation charge but they charged me
