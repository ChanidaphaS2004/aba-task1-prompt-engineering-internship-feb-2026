However, we got a call that prompted us to check out at the normal time (12pm) as the next customers would arrive. I exllained thay we have been granted late check out and the clerk apologised.

  No simple sheets on the bed either...we could not open the windows because it was very very noisy. 
  Also the windows had no soundproofing whatsoever because the noise was too much!! Also the room had a hair dryer and a kettle that we could not use because the plugs did not fit the sockets and the hotel didn't provide adaptors...So no use of that service in the room either!"

456,Staff,However when I booked this property in advance it was a higher price but booking.com reduced the price before my travel date and the hotel refused to accept the lower price which I felt was unfair for me as they charged twice for cancellation and rebooking. Maybe this was a booking.com issue or the hotel but I was quite unhappy about this since it was not justified by the owner. I spoke to Ali from booking.com and he said there was no cancellation charge but they charged me

461,Room,Our plumbing had complications twice.
461,Staff,"Moreover, the cleaning crew cleaned out our rooms and threw out a box of cookies next to our bags that was meant to be a gift. These cookies are only made in Thessaloniki and cost us 25 euros. When we asked if they had seem them, the owners brought them out of the trash room and offered to spray them as if that would be acceptable for an edible gift during COVID pandemic cautions. It was nice that they tried, but they should be refunding us for the cookies we lost. I feel bad writing a negative review because they were kind; however, only things near the garbage should be thrown out. Not stuff next to guests' belongings. I was extremely disappointed in how they dealt with the situation, and that they thought it was acceptable to take an edible gift out of a trash room and continue as if nothing happened."
